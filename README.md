# AWS Instance setup for Udacity DLND
### Work in progress!!!
Credits for this go to http://course.fast.ai/ for creating the initial AWS setup scripts. I merely modified them for use with Udacity-DL AMIs for g2.2xlarge instances. 

This page provides instructions for setting up your g2.2xlarge AWS instance for Udacity DLND.

## Note: 
Here, I assume you haven't created an instance already. If you have, you can terminate and follow the steps below to redo the setup (if you want) and ssh into your instance using the command line. 

## Preliminary steps:
### Windows/Mac users:
1. The easiest way to do this is to start by installing Cygwin. You can download it [here](https://www.cygwin.com/). 

   The `wget` command is not installed by default in Cygwin, and we'd need it later. To install `wget`, select the `wget` package as shown below:

   If `wget` is selected to install, the screen should look like this:

   Click next to complete the installation and you can now run `wget` using the `Cygwin Terminal` or `Cygwin64 Terminal` (if you have installed the 64-bit version).
